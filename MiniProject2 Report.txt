                                            Topic about Machine Learning


I chose the topic of machine learning for my miniproject2 since it is popular and widely used in such as the field of computer vision. Before then, I learn nothing about Machine Learning so it’s a good opportunity for me to explore some new knowledge. 
The first thing I know to learn it is the definition of Machine Learning. It is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of 
Artificial intelligence. The algorithms of Machine Learning build a mathematical model based on the sample data, known as “training data”, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. 
The next step I am going to do is to choose a open-source software. There are multiple softwares for me to learn. Here I choose Tensorflow to start, it is developed by Google and also widely used in deep learning now.
For this project, my goal is to learn some basic operations in TensorFlow and try to learn images classification.
