# Machine Learning (Miniproject2)

  I chose the topic of machine learning for my miniproject2 since it is popular and widely used in such as the field of computer vision. Before then, I learn nothing about Machine Learning so it’s a good opportunity for me to explore some new knowledge.<br/>
  The first thing I know to learn is the definition of Machine Learning. It is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of Artificial intelligence. The algorithms of Machine Learning build a mathematical model based on the sample data, known as “training data”, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. <br/>
  The next step I am going to do is to choose a open-source software. There are multiple softwares for me to learn. Here I choose Tensorflow to start, it is developed by Google and also widely used in deep learning now.<br/>
  For this project, my goal is to learn some basic operations in TensorFlow and try to use it to detect images & images classification.<br/>
Tensorflow provides me with good examples to start learning.<br/>
This code is going to practice the basic image classification. It uses the __Fashion MNIST__ dataset with low resolutions to classify. 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. <br/>
There are 9 classes here for me to classify: 'T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot'<br/>
For results: correct predictions are marked "blue", incorrect predictions are marked "red"<br/>
The screenshots for result and accuray are shown below.<br/>
